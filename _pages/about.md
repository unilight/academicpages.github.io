I am a master student supervised by Prof. Tomoki Toda in [Toda Laboratory](https://www.toda.is.i.nagoya-u.ac.jp/) at the Graduate School of Informatics, Nagoya University starting from April 2019. Prior to that, I was a research student in Toda Laboratory in Nagoya University with advisor Prof. Tomoki Toda. I was also a research assistant at the Institute of Information Science (IIS) in Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan with advisor Prof. Hsin-Min Wang. I received my Bachelor's degree from National Taiwan University in June 2018, majoring in Computer Science and Information Engineering (CSIE).

My research interests include speech processing, natural language processing and machine learning. In particular, I am currently working on speech synthesis and voice conversion using deep generative models.

I also love street dancing (locking). My team participated in a national dance contest. Check out the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfGe7zuQ5g)
